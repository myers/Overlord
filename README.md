# Overlord

Every time think of the word "spawn" I hear "SPAWN MORE OVERLORDS" in that
Zerg voice that talks to me all the time.  This same voice often says "EAT 
MORE GUMMI BEARS".  

This plugin does two things: Stop all creatures from spawning, and give you
a /spawn command to let you add creatures you want.

This is mostly useful for testing [Pogic](https://github.com/myers/Pogic/).
